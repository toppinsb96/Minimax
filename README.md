Minimax Game Agent 

Uses Minimax trees to create moves that the AI chooses. 

The Tic-Tac-Toe agent is unbeatable, because it has a low enough depth for the agent to discern all possible moves.
The Connect-Four agent is beatable as the depth of the Minimax tree for Connect-Four is too massive for a normal computer to compute.
As such it has depth limitation. 

Tic-Tac-Toe: Unbeatable
Connect-Four: Beatable
